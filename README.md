Hi there, I’m Nsubuga Edrine👋
Web Developer | Exploring AI & Web3 student, Programming and machine learning student.

I am an aspiring web developer focused on building strong fundamentals in JavaScript and modern web development. I value clean code, clear structure, and understanding how things work under the hood.

I am currently strengthening my frontend skills while gradually exploring how AI and Web3 concepts can integrate into future web applications.

I am pursuing an IT course at Uganda Christian University and keep up with me to learn more as we win big together.
